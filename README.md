This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

This is Todo List app helps you manage your todos in an efficient way. Every `todo` belongs to a `project`, so that way you can easily manage related todos. You can create, edit or delete a project. However, you can only create, edit or mark a todo as completed.
